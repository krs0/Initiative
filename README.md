# Initiative Mod for HoMM III (VCMI)

A VCMI mod that separates **Initiative** from **Speed** in *Heroes of Might and Magic III*.  

---

## Overview
In the original HoMM III, **Speed** serves two purposes:

- Determines how far a creature can move on the battlefield.
- Determines the **initiative order** — who acts first in combat.

This mod splits those into two distinct stats:

- **Speed** – governs movement range.
- **Initiative** – governs turn order.

## Gameplay and Design Benefits

### 1. Deeper Tactical Diversity
Currently, a fast creature like the Phoenix is both highly mobile and always acts first.  

By separating the two stats, you can have:

- **Slow but quick-to-act** units (e.g., assassins or casters that strike early but move little).  
- **Fast but slow-to-react** units (e.g., cavalry that covers distance but acts later).

This adds more strategic depth in army composition, battlefield positioning, and timing.

### 2. Improved Unit Balancing
Many HoMM3 creatures are mispriced or underpowered because **Speed** controls too many aspects at once.  

With Initiative separated, balance can be fine-tuned:

- Melee units can be slower on the field but still responsive in turn order.  
- Flyers can retain mobility without always acting first.

---

### 3. Expanded Game Content
On larger maps or high-level play, HoMM3 can become repetitive — same skills, artifacts, and spells dominate.  

Adding Initiative opens new design possibilities:

- Spells, artifacts, or hero skills that affect Initiative separately from Speed.  
- Adventure map objects or events that modify Initiative order.

---

### 4. Greater Replay Value and Mod Potential
Distinct Initiative profiles can create more unique faction playstyles:

- **Inferno**: fast movers but delayed reaction — reckless and impulsive.  
- **Tower**: slow movers but high initiative — precise and methodical.  
- **Stronghold**: both low — brute strength over speed or finesse.

This increases replayability and modding potential.

## Downsides

### 1. Increased Complexity
HoMM3’s simplicity is part of its charm — *Speed = movement + turn order* is easy to understand.  
Splitting the stat adds a new layer players must track and learn.

### 2. Balance Disruption
Current unit balance, costs, spells, artifacts, and hero specialties all depend on Speed.  
Separating Initiative would require extensive rebalancing and testing.

### 3. Legacy Feel & Compatibility
A major appeal of HoMM3 is nostalgia and consistency with the classic formula.  
This change alters a core mechanic and may alienate some players.

Additionally, many mods, maps, and AI scripts assume Speed as a single stat — those would need updates or could break.
